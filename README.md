# Personalized Greeting Web Page

## Objective

The goal is to create a web page that prompts the user to enter their name and then displays a personalized greeting. This greeting should only appear after the user submits their name.

## Requirements

### HTML
- An input field for the user's name.
- A submit button.
- A placeholder for the greeting message that will be dynamically generated.

### CSS
- Style the input field and button for aesthetics.
- Style the greeting message to distinguish it from other text elements on the page.

### JavaScript
- Capture the user's name from the input field when the submit button is clicked.
- Generate a greeting message using the user's name and display it on the page.

## Instructions

### HTML Structure
Create an `index.html` file with a form that includes:
- An input field for the name.
- A submit button.
- An empty `<div>` or `<span>` for the greeting.

### Styling with CSS
Style the form and greeting message in a `style.css` file. Ensure the form elements are visually appealing and the greeting message is prominently displayed.

### Adding Interactivity with JavaScript
Write a script in a `script.js` file that:
- Listens for the form submission.
- Prevents the default form submission behavior.
- Retrieves the name from the input field.
- Displays a personalized greeting in the designated area.
